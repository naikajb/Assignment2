QUESTION: Does my program work correctly, or does it misbehave! WHY?
          Display the contents of both arrays, then submit a separate document (pdf, MS-Word, or text)
          along with your assignment indicating whether or not the copying is correct.
          In either case, you need to explain the reason for the correctness or failure of your
          program's behavior/output.



My program works correctly for two reasons.

First, it works because the 8 described classes of the assignment were grouped into the parent class 'Transportation'. Because of this, an array can be created with the different child classes since its makes them fit into one variable type.

Secondly, the program works because the findLeastandMostExpensive() method iterates through every element of the array and checks the class of the object before continuing with any other operations. This step prevents the method from throwing a ClassCastException if it tries to utilize properties that are only present in the Aircraft class.
